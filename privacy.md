# Privacy Policy For Facebook Comments Workflow

## Overview

Facebook Comments Workflow is a Chrome extension that helps authorised users scan, review, classify, record and export comments from Facebook posts, reels and videos that they have opened in their browser.

The extension processes information only to provide this comment review and moderation workflow. It does not use information for advertising, behavioural profiling, credit decisions or unrelated purposes.

The extension is not affiliated with, endorsed by or operated by Meta Platforms, Inc. or Facebook.

## Scope Of This Policy

This policy explains what information the extension handles, why it handles that information, where it is stored, when it may be transmitted and how users can remove it.

For this policy, handling includes collecting, reading, processing, storing, exporting, transmitting or synchronising information, including information stored only on the user's device.

## Information The Extension Handles

### Facebook Website Content

When the user opens and scans an eligible Facebook page, the extension may process information already available in that page or in Facebook responses associated with that page, including:

* Facebook post, reel or video text and titles
* Facebook comment and reply text
* Facebook display names and usernames
* Facebook profile URLs
* Facebook post, comment and reply URLs
* Comment and post identifiers
* Post and comment dates and times
* Reply relationships
* Hidden or visible comment status
* Reaction, reply or comment counts when available
* Comment types selected by the user or detected by the extension
* Moderation history including assignments, changes, clears, hides and unhides when those features are enabled

The extension does not access Facebook Messenger or private Facebook messages.

### Personally Identifiable Information

The extension may handle information that identifies or can be linked to a person, including:

* Facebook display names
* Facebook usernames
* Facebook profile URLs
* The actioning staff name entered in extension settings
* Facebook comment and post identifiers
* A randomly generated extension installation identifier used to distinguish synchronisation events

### Website And Tab Information

The extension may process the URL and title of the active Facebook page to identify the source post, connect the dashboard to the correct Facebook tab and create links in copied or exported records.

The extension does not collect or monitor the user's general browsing history. Its required website access is limited to the declared Facebook domains. Access to a separate HTTPS webhook origin is requested only when the user enters and enables that endpoint.

### Workflow And User Activity Information

The extension may record actions performed within its own workflow, including:

* Scanning and selecting comments
* Assigning, changing or clearing comment types
* Recording hide or unhide actions when enabled
* Copying or exporting selected information
* Sending selected rows to a configured spreadsheet endpoint
* Synchronisation attempts, success times, response summaries and errors

The extension does not record general mouse movement, general scrolling, unrelated keystrokes or activity on other websites.

### Settings And Technical Information

The extension stores settings and technical state required to operate, including:

* Dashboard layout and display preferences
* Scan, review, table and export options
* Actioning staff name
* Comment type history and deduplication information
* Saved review sessions and selected rows
* Synchronisation status and timing
* A randomly generated installation identifier
* A user-supplied webhook URL and provider type when configured

A webhook URL may contain a secret, signature or access token depending on the service selected by the user. The extension treats the URL as configuration data and does not use it to sign in to Facebook.

## How Information Is Collected

The extension obtains information through the following user-facing functions:

* Reading the content and metadata of an eligible Facebook page that the user has opened
* Processing Facebook page responses required to identify comments, replies, dates and hidden state
* Receiving settings and edits entered by the user
* Restoring information previously stored by the extension in the user's browser
* Receiving shared comment history from a webhook endpoint configured by the user

The extension does not use remote JavaScript or WebAssembly. All executable extension code is included in the installed extension package.

## How Information Is Used

The extension uses handled information only to:

* Scan and display Facebook comments and replies
* Support review, selection and classification of comments
* Detect and display relevant comment metadata
* Record comment type and visibility history
* Attribute workflow actions to the configured staff name
* Copy, download or export information at the user's request
* Send selected records to a user-configured spreadsheet or webhook endpoint
* Synchronise shared moderation history when enabled
* Restore settings and in-progress workflow state
* Prevent duplicate history and spreadsheet records
* Maintain, secure and troubleshoot the extension's disclosed functionality

## Local Storage

By default, the extension stores information locally in the user's Chrome browser using Chrome extension storage, IndexedDB and tab session storage.

Locally stored information may include settings, scanned comment information, review rows, comment type history, synchronisation status and the installation identifier.

The developer does not receive locally stored information through the extension by default and cannot access the user's local browser storage.

## Optional Webhook And Spreadsheet Transmission

The extension does not include a default developer-operated data server.

Information is transmitted outside the browser only when the user configures and uses an HTTPS webhook or spreadsheet endpoint. Supported examples include a Google Apps Script web app, Microsoft Power Automate or another compatible HTTPS endpoint selected by the user.

Depending on the enabled function, transmitted information may include:

* Extension version and installation identifier
* Event and request identifiers
* Facebook names, profile URLs and comment text
* Post, comment and reply URLs
* Post and comment dates
* Comment classifications and previous classifications
* Actioning staff name
* Hide or unhide history when enabled
* Selected table columns and values
* Synchronisation times and trigger information

The endpoint provider and the person or organisation controlling that endpoint determine how transmitted information is stored, accessed, retained and deleted after receipt. Users should review the privacy and security terms that apply to their selected endpoint.

## Information Sharing

The extension does not sell user data.

The extension does not share user data with advertisers, data brokers or information resellers.

Information may be transferred only:

* To an HTTPS endpoint deliberately configured or invoked by the user
* When necessary to provide the extension's disclosed comment workflow
* When required by applicable law
* When necessary to investigate security, fraud or abuse

The developer does not permit human review of extension data unless the user explicitly provides specific information for support, review is necessary for security or legal compliance or the information has been aggregated and anonymised for permitted internal operations.

## Information The Extension Does Not Intentionally Collect

The extension does not intentionally collect:

* Facebook passwords
* Facebook authentication cookies or session tokens
* Credit card or payment information
* Financial account information
* Health records
* Precise device location or GPS information
* Email, SMS, Messenger or other private communications
* General browsing history unrelated to the Facebook workflow

User-generated Facebook content may incidentally contain sensitive personal information. If that information appears in a scanned comment or post, the extension processes it only as website content required for the selected workflow.

## Data Retention

Local information is retained for as long as required to preserve the user's settings, sessions and comment history unless the user deletes it.

Typical retention behaviour includes:

* Tab session information remains until the tab session is cleared or closed
* Extension settings remain until reset, cleared or removed
* Comment type history remains until records are deleted, history is cleared or the extension's storage is removed
* The installation identifier remains until extension storage is cleared or the extension is uninstalled
* Exported files, copied information and spreadsheet records remain outside the extension until removed by the user or the relevant system administrator
* Information sent to a configured endpoint is retained according to the settings and policies of that endpoint

## User Choices And Deletion

Users can control data handling by:

* Choosing which Facebook comments to scan, select and export
* Disabling automatic scanning
* Disabling hide and unhide history detection
* Disabling periodic webhook synchronisation
* Removing the configured webhook URL
* Deleting individual comment history records
* Clearing comment history through the extension settings
* Clearing extension site or browser data
* Removing the extension from Chrome

Removing or clearing the extension does not automatically delete information previously copied, downloaded or transmitted to a spreadsheet, webhook or other external system. Users must delete that information from the receiving system separately.

Requests concerning information held in an endpoint operated by an employer or another organisation should be directed to the administrator of that endpoint.

## Security

The extension restricts its required website access to supported Facebook domains and requests separate endpoint access only for a user-configured HTTPS origin.

Webhook transmissions use HTTPS. The extension does not transmit user data through an intentionally unencrypted webhook connection.

Local information is stored through Chrome's browser storage systems and is protected by the security of the user's browser profile, operating system and device. Users should protect access to their device, Chrome profile and any webhook URL containing a secret or signature.

No method of electronic storage or transmission can be guaranteed to be completely secure.

## Chrome Web Store Limited Use Disclosure

The extension's use and transfer of user data is limited to providing or improving its single purpose and user-facing features.

The extension does not use or transfer user data for personalised advertising, retargeting, interest-based advertising, data brokerage, creditworthiness decisions or lending purposes.

The extension does not transfer user data except where necessary to provide its disclosed functionality, comply with applicable law, protect against security threats or complete a business transfer with any consent required by applicable policy or law.

The developer's use and transfer of information received through Chrome extension permissions complies with the Chrome Web Store User Data Policy including its Limited Use requirements.

## Children's Privacy

The extension is intended for authorised workplace or organisational users and is not directed to children under 13. The developer does not knowingly use the extension to collect personal information directly from children.

## Changes To This Policy

This policy may be updated when the extension's features, permissions or data practices change. The updated policy will include a revised last updated date.

Material changes will be reflected in the extension's published privacy information and, where required, in the extension interface or Chrome Web Store listing.
